# Diesase maps module
## WCSCC Computational Systems Biology for Complex Human Disease, 4-9 December 2022

During this training session you will learn about [disease maps](disease-maps.org), and in particular about the [COVID-19 Disease Map](https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190).

You will work with R code to programmatically access the contents of the map, search for drug targets, correlate map contents with omics data nad and identify network neighborhood of targets of interest.

### Prerequisites:
- R [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org)
- RStudio [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com)
- A text editor with JSON syntax (e.g. Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

### **Setup**
Run `Task_0_setup.R` to install all necessary packages and access the contents of the SYSCID Disease Map.

### **Task 1 (detailed instructions in the code and on site)**
Explore bioentities and their annotations in the [COVID19 Disease Map](https://covid19map.elixir-luxembourg.org), both visually and programmatically.

### **Task 2 (detailed instructions in the code and on site)**
Retrieve information about known drugs targeting elements in the Map.

### **Task 3 (detailed instructions in the code and on site)**
Expand the network structure of the map and combine it with the expression datasets available in the map
