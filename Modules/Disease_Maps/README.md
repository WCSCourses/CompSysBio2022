# Diesase maps module

During this training session you will learn about [disease maps](disease-maps.org), and in particular about the [COVID-19 Disease Map](https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190).

You will work with R code to programmatically access the contents of the map, search for drug targets, correlate map contents with omics data nad and identify network neighborhood of targets of interest.

## Setup

Run the file `Task_0_setup.R` to install all missing libraries (already preinstalled if you use the VM provided by course organisers) and run a small code example.
